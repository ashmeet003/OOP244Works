The first part of workshop was pretty easy. Though i did some minor mistakes as using: "using namespace sdds;" instead of "namespace sdds{}", which caused few errors to occur.
The part two of workshop took a lot of time. 
It took me hours to understand my mistake and understand few function.
I used fgetc() to check end of file to be read. Using fgetc caused it to read the first character of next line, as a result fscanf statement omitted the first character and saved the incomplete name in the struct.
Hence, I got to clear few basic concepts of programming because of the workshop.
