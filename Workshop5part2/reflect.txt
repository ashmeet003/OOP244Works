I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to
 complete my workshops and assignments.

The workshop taught a lot about binary member functions, type casting, member functions and class functions.
Though it was a bit difficult at first point to use binary or unary symbols to use as operators, by comparing them with usual function types, the work became easier.
This workshop also included to create main.cpp files by ourselves which was another challenge but good anough.
I faced problem during helper function in part1 of function where I used helper function but realised that could be solved by using an additional function to extract value using member function.
