The workshop, based on inheritence, cleared many concepts:
It helped understand the hierarchies among classes, and cleared the concept of base class and derived class.
For a moment I thought, why not use protected in derived class, but somehow it wasn't working. Therefore, I started reading notes briefly and understood the meaning of word protected more clearly. (It basically means that the specifications under protected is available to derived class only).
Though not the part of inheritence, the workshop helped me gain a clear understanding of using word const, and usage of std::ostream& and std::istream&, which might be a bit blur earlier. (Now it feels like I almost know the correct usage of keyword const (I hope)).

The workshop also involved the concept of shadowing the functions, like print(), and reusing the functions from base class, like valid().
While doing the project it also seemed to me to use keyword virtual learnt in last lecture, but then I dropped the idea as it felt like, my understanding is not that thorough.

Last but not the least, I was stuck at read(), hence I referred to a peer's code and understood the concept to write the function. It resulted out that, I was just overthinking few concepts and was making read function a bit confusing.
Hence, learnt the lesson to take a short break and think over before resuming working.
