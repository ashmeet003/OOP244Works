I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to
 complete my workshops and assignments.

The workshop helped me went through ifstream again. It is a kind of weak point for me but I tried to do my best and understand the concepts.
Few concepts are engraved in my mind now:
-Header file should not contain std,
-Implement parent's class destructor as virtual, and,
-Usage of inheritance.
The project was also a bit fun, since it included html text(atleast format), it is always fun to mix things.
I tried to limit the use of syntax by creating functions for them, stll in some places, I guess, syntax is repeated.

For milestone3, I referred to my friend for a particular function, to understand the problem.
It was using similar syntax, hence I tried using templates.
However it was a failed attempt, and due to less time, I couldn't practice on it.
However, I would continue to make that code perfect(that was part of Utils class) and commit on github.
Atleast I tried using templates, and it was nice to try something new. Not sure why it showed erro, like: compiler cannot deduce the template.
So, I would that agian in upcoming days.
